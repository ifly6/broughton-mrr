# Magistrates of the Roman Republic

It is my belief that the first two volumes of T R S Broughton's *Magistrates of the Roman Republic* [did not have its copyright renewed and are therefore in the public domain](https://guides.library.cornell.edu/copyright/publicdomain). No such renewal appears in the Copyright Office register for the years where it would have had to have been renewed for it not to fall into the public domain. It does not appear that MRR 3 is yet in the public domain. If its copyright resides with the author, it will expire 70 years after Broughton's death (ie 2063).

This project includes the images of scans of MRR vols 1â€“2. The images for MRR 1 are taken from [HathiTrust](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015009351001). The images for MRR 2 were taken by a [CZUR Aura](https://shop.czur.com/products/aura) overhead scanner in black-and-white mode. The scans for both were then fed into an `unpaper` pipeline for cleaning, processing, etc. A not-insubstantial amount of work has been done to clean up the scans; the images in `raw` without suffixes such as `skip` are usually rescanned or cleaned-up versions of the original scans.

The processing code is publicly available so that other people comment on or perhaps learn from it. Solving the problems relating to inconsistent page sizing, aspect ratio adjustment, and bothersome scan borders was not altogether trivial.

After processing, the images were then bundled into a PDF (suffixed `unpaper`) and were fed into `ocrmypdf` (relying on `tesseract`). The OCR'd PDF (suffixed `ocr`) was then edited in Adobe Acrobat XI for renumbering by actual pages, removal of missed duplicate pages, image optimisation, and metadata inclusion. Since these steps were done in Acrobat, it is not possible to entirely reproduce the release PDFs entirely progrmamatically.

See `releases` for the final PDF versions.

## Licencing

The GPL v2 licence in this repository applies *to the code*.

The input images for MRR 1 created by Google rehosted here are already in the public domain; I release the input images for MRR 2 also into the public domain. All PDFs derived from those images, as well as those released on the releases tab, I also release into the public domain.

## Thanks

My thanks to those at Google who digitised MRR vol 1, those at CZUR who created such an easy-to-use scanner, the `unpaper` team for producing software which can fix up all the artefacts and errors that are rather unavoidable with even easy-to-use scanners, the `ocrmypdf` team for creating such an easy-to-use OCR endpoint, and those at `tesseract` for creating the OCR software itself that can read English and Greek.

Separately, I also thank the team at the [Digital Prosopography of the Roman Republic](https://romanrepublic.ac.uk) who have already digitised MRR and put it into a searchable web database. Someone needed to do it and they did a brilliant job of it. The only quibble I have with their work is that they do not have pinpoint citations to the page numbers for each statement.
